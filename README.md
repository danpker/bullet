# Bullet

Bullet is an implementation of the [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) 
system for organisation.

This is my learning project for Rust so if you spot something weird in the code
that is probably why. If you have time why not raise an issue or create a PR to
explain what is going wrong.
